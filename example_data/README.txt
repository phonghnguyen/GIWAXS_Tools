Two data files are included in this directory: 

EPEN_0p1deg_120s_08241133_0001.tif corresponds to a detector image taken for a ~4.5 kDa regioregular P3HT thin film at a grazing incidence angle of 0.1 degrees and an exposure time of 120s. 

lab6_3deg_10s_0p5throck_08241022_0001.tif corresponds to a detector image taken for a LaB6 calibrant at a grazing incidence angle of 3 degrees and an exposure time of 10s, rocking the sample stage in the theta direction by 0.5 degrees to better populate the Ewald sphere. 

Using the LaB6 calibrant file, the beam center is at bc_x = 1427.66, bc_y = 2381.05, and sample-to-detector distance (R) = 289.52 mm. The X-ray photon energy is 12.7 keV at SSRL 11-3, where these images where collected. The pixel size (in x and y) is 0.073242 mm.
