Three data files are included in this directory. All three files were measured during the same beam time at SSRL 11-3 for the same sample, changing only the grazing incidence angle.

Using a LaB6 calibrant (file not included), the beam center is at bc_x = 1535.46, bc_y = 2908, and sample-to-detector distance (R) = 315.395 mm. The X-ray photon energy is 12.7 keV at SSRL 11-3, where these images where collected. The pixel size (in x and y) is 0.073242 mm.

These files are used in the example_usage notebook to demonstrate angle-resolved GIWAXS/depth profiling.
